### Hi there, I'm Eren! 👋

As a **Senior Computer Science student** at Kielce University of Technology (Poland), I am bridging the gap between hardware and software. My primary focus lies in **Embedded Systems**, **C++ development**, and **Scalable Backend Architectures**.

Currently, I am deeply engaged in developing **autonomous drone systems**, where I apply low-level programming concepts to real-world hardware challenges. Unlike a typical student approach, I treat my projects as engineering products—focusing on memory optimization, system architecture, and clean code principles.

### 🚀 What I Bring to the Table

* **🛠️ Core Engineering:** Advanced C++, C, Kotlin, and JavaScript.
* **🚀 Embedded Systems:** Experience with STM32, Arduino, and Linux Kernel modules.
* **🌐 Backend & Data:** Building robust APIs with Node.js and managing data with MySQL/Oracle.
* **🔧 Tools:** Proficient in Git, Docker, and Figma for end-to-end development.

I am looking for **Junior Software Engineering** or **Internship** opportunities in **Poland** or **Remote (Europe)** where I can contribute to challenging technical projects. I am ready to transition from academia to industry with a professional mindset and a strong technical foundation.

📫 **Open to connecting with engineers and recruiters in the Embedded and Backend domains.**
